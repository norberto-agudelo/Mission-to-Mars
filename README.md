# Mission to Mars -Web Scraping with HTML/CSS Analysis.
# Module 10
## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to apply the Web Scraping approach and several tools used to extract information from websites.  Chrome Developer tools are used to identify HTML components related to the data needed.

Other tools such as Beautiful Soup and Splinter are used to automate a web browser and gather the data required. Additionally, Mongo, a NoSQL database is used to store the data as well as Flask, HTML and CSS are used to create a web application.

In this case, Robin, a Junior Data Scientist who wants to work for NASA, is planning to write a script to gather information from several web sites about space. She wants to collect data related to mission to Mars “from all over the web and display it in a central location without spending her feee time gathering the data manually”

To do that, she is going to use all the tool stated above to gather data, store it, create a web application and customize it with HTML and CSS. Finally, she will create a portfolio to showcase her project using Bootstrap

This project challenge aims to add more polish to Robin's web app built it, She wants   to include images of Mars’s hemispheres from NASA’s  site that is scraping-friendly. She needs to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images and titles of Mars’s hemispheres, store data on a Mongo database, and display the data.
